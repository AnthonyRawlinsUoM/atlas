                    <p>Fire behaviour
                        simulation is based on the Phoenix RapidFire model, and incorporates different prescribed burning treatment rates and locations, different weather streams and different ignition locations, as well as base layers supplied by
                        state and territory fire management agencies. Impact estimation is based on published techniques for relating fire behaviour and other outputs from Phoenix to values such as life and property loss, infrastructure damage and
                        vegetation sensitive to particular fire intervals.</p>
                    <p>Risk estimation is based on Bayesian Decision Networks, which estimate the risk to each value at each treatment level from the simulation-derived distributions of data and
                        provide a basis for comparison between regions that explicitly incorporates the observed frequency of fire weather conditions in each case study area. For more information, see <a href="/publications">Cirulis et al. 2019.</a></p>
