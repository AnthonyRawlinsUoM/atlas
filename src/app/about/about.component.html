                        <li class="ui item"><strong>Hazard or fuel reduction:</strong> prescribed burning is used to reduce the amount of fuel in order to reduce the intensity, rate of spread and size of subsequent unplanned fires. These effects
                            potentially increase
                            opportunities for safe and effective suppression of bushfires. Risk to human communities, built assets, infrastructure and livelihoods is therefore potentially reduced.</li>

                        <li class="ui item"><strong>Environmental management:</strong> use of prescribed fire to alter fire regimes to reduce risks to biodiversity, ecosystem processes and natural resources, via changes to the incidence, intensity
                            and area burned by
                            unplanned fires.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Current land management practices focus on risk-based approaches for prescribed burning, which is consistent with the approach outlined in the National Disaster Risk Reduction Framework, where one of the guiding principles is
                        that <em>"All sectors have shared but defined responsibilities to reduce disaster risk."</em> The Framework is also clear that there is a requirement that <em>"data and information informs implementation planning and
                            execution".</em></p>
